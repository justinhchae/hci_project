Defendant was waiting on trooper to restart. Because Trooper cannot appear visually on video, cannot take plea. 

While waiting for prior case, moved onto another case. 

People are getting warrants (showing up to court, not knowing to zoom into court).

Asked for breakout room.

people unable to connect (audio, video) 

In another case, the officer appeared to provide testimony. Judge ruled after hearing from prosecution and defender. Defendant tried to speak up but was shut down by the judge, saying she already ruled. 

Judge made attempts to call out to people on the call (moto e 6) the device name. 

Defendant expressed it is not possible to do pre-trial, defendant said that he is calling but only getting voicemail.

There was one defendant with multiple charges in different crimes. The judge spoke sternly that the defendant must be careful or risk jail. He seemed to be accumulating new charges. 

Case with Robert Hill; judge, ""the oldest case in the courtroom"" 

There was a lot of communication back and forth about coordinating dates. 

Judge mentioned many defendants citing speedy trial.. 

Seeking supplemental violation (defendant has failed to report to adult program) since leaving electronic monitoring. The defense remarked that the defendant is working two jobs. 

Judge clarified rulings on continuance on a few occasions. 

Judge cited case management order to get cases moving and resolved. 

Explained why he did not want cases to be pushed out 6 weeks. 

Someone asked to speak up, judge asked her to wait until proceeding was finished. 

Judge has to manage a lot of logistical issues in the call. Signal to defendants what they have to do, wait for people to come on and off mute. 

A defendant was arrested on a gun offense with a prior gun offense. Defense cited new born child and non-violence. Pros cited repeat gun posession. Defense asked for curfew. Judge denied movement request. 

A defendant appeared with a lawyer who was fired but his new laywer did not appear. The judge said that he would grant a continuance for the defendant since the lawyer did not appear.

Does not have court sheet at start (blames clerk)
Interrupted defense attorney to quickly hang up on a call
Explains consecutive charges and consequences of new cases
Seems to have a little difficulty finding files
Attempts to organize cases and keep his workload manageable
Says he feels pressure to gets cases moving and resolve
Answers questions, but seems a little rushed
Denies extended curfew request despite wanting to see his baby; it seems defendant had frequently asked for extended curfew for different reasons in the past
Seems to be patient with attorneys who have multiple cases
Does not give much time for response (says he called for awhile)
Seems kind of rude to division prisoners; pretty impatient (""I could set your bail to one million dollars cash if you would like"" seems like a rude comment)
Does answer defendants' questions
Explains sentences when asked
Is very straightforward, but it can come off as rude (""You're a grown man, you can make this decision"")
Very impatient with defendant; when asked for further explanation of plea, judge grew impatient (""I'm done playing with you"")
Demands ""yes"" or ""no"" answer when defendant starts explaining his circumstances
Defendant's attorney asks for moment to allow defendant to collect himself, which he grants
Seems to value the law how its written, and looks down on pleas that lower sentences, though he does accept them (""You should be in prison for 6 to 30 years. That's how I see it."")
Judge seems to get visibly frustrated with defendants when they speak
Very upset when he gets interrupted (""Gentlemen don't interrupt people"")
Explains that he is harsh because he doesn't want to see defendants make bad choices",,Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Agree,,Unsure,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Disagree,,Strongly Agree,,Unsure,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Unsure,,Strongly Agree,,Strongly Agree,,Agree,,Strongly Agree,,,
